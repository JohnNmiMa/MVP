sequence of description area's text data

1) A <div class='snippetDesStyle'>That contains HTML</div>
2) Call snippetFormResetter:
   snippetFormResetter($snippet, $snippetForm)
   - call getDomNodeAsString() to get the description and code text data
     getDomNodeAsString($desDiv, $codeDiv)
     - for the description, ???
     - for the code, simply copy each $codeDiv.children('pre') element into an array
       - For each node, get the .text(). This will contain no HTML, just text.
       - then join all of the elements together into a string containing the HTML of the $codeDiv,
         tacking on a '\n' line return at the end of each string.
       The line returns keep the text string in the right form.

   - call setupSnippetForm($snippet, titleText, desText, codeText, ...)
     setupSnippetForm($snippet, titleText, desText, codeText, ...)
     - populate the des and code textareas in the form
       - $("form #titleField").val(titleText);
       - $("form #desField").val(desText);
       - $("form #codeField").val(codeText);
       Now the form's textareas contain just single text strings. These text string
       will be interpreted by the CodeMirror editor, and produce a bit of HTML for each
       line of text. When the editing is finished in the editor, the editor's DOM contents
       will be copied back into the form's textarea.

       - call setupCodeMirrorEditors(...)
         setupCodeMirrorEditors(...)
         - this will create the CodeMirror editors for each of the snippet form's textareas.
           The data in the snippet form will be copied to the editors .CodeMirror-code div.
           The editors need to be refreshed to have the contents show.
         
3) Call saveEditedSnippet --> to save the CodeMirror editors contents
  - call updateTextareasWithEditorsContents
    - if there are contents in the editor,
      - get the code editor's .html() of .CodeMirror-code divs (editorsDomContents)
      - save the html (editorsDomContents) into the snippet form's code 
        field ($codeField.val(editorsDomContent)

    Now, the snippet form has the html contents of the editors .CodeMirror-code div.
  - get access to each of the snippet form's fields
    - title = $('#snippetForm #titleField').val();
    - desText = $('#snippetForm #desField').val();
    - codeText  = $('#snippetForm #codeField').val();
  - call updateSnippet --> to save the snippet form's data back into the snippet's divs
    - $(.snippetDesText').html(desText)
    - $(.snippetCodeText').html(codeText)
    This will put the html from the snippet form into the snippet's div fields. The .html()
    function will create DOM nodes for all HTML tags stored in the form.

Code Flow:
1) Click the snippet edit button
2) For each <pre> node in the snippet's .snippetCodeText div, get the element.text() and save
   the text into an array. When all nodes have been save as text in the array, joint the array
   into a large string, with a line-break at the end of every string.
3) Take this large string with line-breaks embedded inside, and initialize the snippet form's
   textareas with this string - $('#codeField').val(codeTextStr)
4) When the snippet form is initialized properly, create the CodeMirror edtitors. This will
   copy all of the snippet form's textarea content and get stored into CodeMirrors editors -
   .CodeMirror-code div.
5) Edit the contents in the CodeMirror editor. When finished, save the contents and show the
   newly edited snippet
6) Copy the editor's html contents $('.CodeMirror-code').html() into the snippet form $('#codeField').val(editorsDomContent)
7) Copy the snippet form's contents $(.$codeField').val() into the snippet's div as html -
   $(.snippetCodeText').html(codeText)

Code Flow again
1) Gather each node in $(.snippetCodeText).text() into a large string embedded with line-feeded.
   - this large string contain only text, no html
2) Initialize the snippet form with the large string - $('#codeField').val(largeString)
3) Create the CodeMirror editor and edit contents, and then click 'save' button
4) Get the editor's html contents - $('.CodeMirror-code').html()
5) Save the html into the snippet form - $('#codeField').val(editorsDomContent)
6) Copy the snippet form's contents into the snippet - $(.snippetCodeText').html(codeText)

Description Flow:
1) Get html for each node in the description div - $('.snippetDesText').html()
2) Add the node's html into an html array. Joint the array inserting line-breaks after each line
3) Insert the large string into the snippet form - $('#desField').val(largeString)
4) Create the CodeMirror editor for the description textarea and edit contents, then click 'save' button
5) To save the editor's contents back to the snippet form:
   - for each <pre> element, get the .html() string. Add the string to an array
   - joint the array into a large string (don't need to embed line-breaks).
6) Save the large string into the snippet form - $('#desField').val(largStr)
7) Copy the snippet form's contents into the snippet - $(.snippetDesText').html(desText)
