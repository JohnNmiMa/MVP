Scenario: Create a new snippet
1) User selects the #snippetAdd icon
  - viewUtils.enterNewSnippet() is called
2) enterNewSnippet():
   - create a snippetForResetter() // So the original snippet can be shown with new
     data when done creating the new snippet - not applicable here (there is no original
     snippet - we are creating one)
   - enable the full-screen modal, so the user won't get confused during snippet edit
   - relocate the #snippetForm right before the #userSnippets div
   - setupCodeEditor($snippetForm, "") // give it an empty string - a fresh code section
3)   setupCodeEditor():
     - CodeMirror(#embeddedCode, options) is called
       - creates the code editor, and initializes it's contents (empty contents for add)
       - ### use CodeMirror.fromTextArea(codeField, options)
         - this will create the code editor right after the form's textarea. There is
           associated with the editor ability to put data into the editor and take the
           document data from the editor and put it back into the forn's textarea.

   - the snippetForm should have the title, description and code populated in it,
     it's ready to be seen.
   - show the snippetForm - #snippetForm.show()
   - set focus to the title field in the form
  - the #snippetAdd button is highlighted as selected

4a) User clicks #snippetCancel button
   - viewUtils.cancelSnippet() is called
5a) cancelSnippet():
   - snippetFormReset() is called
6a)  snippetFormReset():
     - $snippetForm.hide() - hide the form
     - reset the form
     - remove the CodeMirror editor from the DOM
     - ? reset the textarea attributes to work again for the next snippet add
     - relocate the snippetForm out of the #userSnippets so it won't get deleted 
       if the userSnippets are deleted during a search or display of a new topic.
     - set isSnippetEditModeEnabled to false
     - If the snippetForm was used to edit a snippet, then the original snippet
       would be displayed again.
     - hide the snippet form

4b) User clicks #snippetSave button
  - viewUtils.saveNewSnippet() is called
5b) saveNewSnippet():
    ### Put the data from the code editor into the form
    - ### Test 1: using the codeEditor.save() method:
          This took the contents of the editor which is a raw text string
          (with spacing and returns and all), and saved it away. It seems that
           to make this display properly in a div, the data needs to be saved
           away in <pre> tags. UPDATE: The pre tags worked. We now have simple
           <div> text in <pre> tags to keep the spacing in the string.
    - ### Test 2: don't use codeEditor.save(). What we would like to do is to 
          take the editors DOM elements (a bunch of spans), and inset them into the
          form's #codeField textarea. Not sure what happens when we get the textarea's
          value. Will it be the DOM elements, or just a string of text?
          !!! Did this - works beautifully. You can then style the code in your code div
    - get the data from the form (title, description, code, topicName)
      - data = $('#snippetForm').serialize() - this gets the data to send over the wire
    - call snippetService.saveNewSnippet() - does an AJAX request to create a new snippet
  - the #snippetAdd button is un-highlighted as deselected

6b) The AJAX success or error methods are called. Let's do the success path
  - displayNewSnippet(id, creator_id, access) is called
7b) displayNewSnippet():
    - the title, description, and code data are retrieved from the form fields
    - buildSnippet() is called -> returns a node string
    - snippetFormReset() is called
8b)   snippetFormReset():
      - $snippetForm.hide() - hide the form
      - reset the form
      - remove the CodeMirror editor from the DOM
      - ? reset the textarea attributes to work again for the next snippet add
      - relocate the snippetForm out of the #userSnippets so it won't get deleted 
        if the userSnippets are deleted during a search or display of a new topic.
      - set isSnippetEditModeEnabled to false
      - If the snippetForm was used to edit a snippet, then the original snippet
        would be displayed again.
      - hide the snippet form

    - add the new snippet to the beginning of #userSnippets
    - bindSnippetSelector() is called to get the snippet selector controls working

  - incrementTopicCount() is called
